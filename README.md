# 🌙🐾 LunarX Mod Menu — weirdss3's Cosmic Cat Chaos 🐒🚀

> *"When the moon hits your Gorilla Tag like a big pizza pie... that's LunarX!"*  
> — Some wise cat probably

## 🐱 What Even Is This?

LunarX is **not your average Gorilla Tag mod menu**. It's made by weirdss3 (or was it a cat?) and it's here to break the moon and maybe some lobbies... in style. 🛸

Built with Unity wizardry, Photon networking mumbo-jumbo, and EasyInputs so you can go *zoom zoom* without touching the floor.

## ✨ Features That May or May Not Be Legal in the Moon

- 🪐 **Platform Spawner** – Who needs ground when you’ve got platforms?
- ⚡ **Speed Boost** – Ever wanted to fly through trees at Mach Banana? Now you can.
- 🎭 **Nickname Changer** – Become someone new. Become... *Jeff.*
- 📑 **Multi-page UI** – Too many features? Slap 'em on another page.
- 🐾 **More coming soon** – Maybe. If the cat lets us code again.

## 🧪 Requirements

- A VR headset (duh)
- Gorilla Tag (double duh)
- Bepis Injector or similar
- Photon & Unity support (if you like things actually working)
- Fingers (preferably yours)

## 🔮 Installation (Summon the Moon Magic)

1. Download the `.dll` file from [the releases page](#) or wherever the cosmic winds take you.
2. Inject it into Gorilla Tag using your favorite .dll injector.
3. Launch the game. If your game breaks, that's a feature not a bug.
4. Press your EasyInput button (you know the one).
5. Profit????

## 🙀 Disclaimer

This is for **educational** and/or **interdimensional** use only.  
Using mods in public lobbies will get you sent to the banana void.  
Please don’t ruin the game for others. Or cats.
